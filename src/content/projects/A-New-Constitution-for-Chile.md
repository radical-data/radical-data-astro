What we offered: MRP analysis that supported the Apruebo campaign for changing the Chilean constitution.

* MRP is currently the most accurate way of doing political polling
* only method that predicted Trump and Brexit
* gold standard in US and some countries in Europe
* however not used much yet outside these countries (not aware of a use in Latin America)
* it can use a normal survey to get very accurate results
* and the results can be used breakdown the population much more finely
* into both geographic areas (of roughly 2000 people for whole of country)
* and demographic areas (e.g. 20-year-old women with a university education who live in the countryside

This process was the beginning to start creating the Digital Campaign Kit to support progressive campaigns in Latin America.
