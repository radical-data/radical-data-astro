Comapping is a project exploring how maps can be used for communities to map themselves. To represent the collective memory of a place, to show crimes of state, or to imagine the future of a place.

Mapping is a tool for rewriting the hidden experiences of places, and comapping seeks to use technology and data to bring us closer to them. Through workshops, data walks and the creation of open-source software, the project supports communities to use participatory mapping to share who they are, where they live and what's important to them.
