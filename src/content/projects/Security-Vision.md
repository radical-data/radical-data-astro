As part of a â‚¬2 million collaboration with Leiden University, Radical Data have been documenting and visualising the use of AIs across the world. The result is a 3D network visualisation displaying the connections between AI projects and the organisations developing and funding them.

How do technologies of computer vision, which promise to replace humans in the understanding of images, work in practice in the field of security, and what are their ethical and political implications?

This project addresses these challenges through an innovative theoretical and methodological framework that investigates the theoretical, empirical and political implications of the development of computer vision in the field of security.&#x20;

In order to carry out this task, the project builds on and advances debates at the intersection of critical security studies, science and technology studies, and visual ethnographic practices.
